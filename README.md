# Hormonalab Symptom Logging Prototype

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://hormonalab-symptom-prototype.vercel.app/](https://hormonalab-symptom-prototype.vercel.app/)

This is a prototype demo application built with **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + React Query + MSW**.  
It simulates symptom logging, predictive insights, and wearable data fetching for Hormonalab.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Symptom Logging Form**
  - Log symptom, severity, duration, notes  
  - Validate inputs with success/error feedback  
  - View past entries in a separate **Recent Entries** page  
  - **Reset** and **Cancel** options for smooth UX  

- **Predictive Insights (Mocked)**
  - Button calls `/api/predict`  
  - Simulates **1–2s API delay**  
  - Displays prediction result  

- **Wearable Data (Mocked)**
  - Connect to wearable (mocked endpoint)  
  - Fetch simulated **heart rate & sleep data**  
  - Manual **Sync refresh**  

- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-first UI with Tailwind CSS  
  - Mobile-friendly navigation menu

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) (with Vite)  
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (for async state + API calls)  
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) (mock APIs with service worker)  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (responsive design)  
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (for deployment)

## 🌐 API Endpoints (Mocked with MSW)

- `POST /api/symptoms` → Save a new symptom entry  
- `GET /api/symptoms` → Fetch all symptoms for the session  
- `POST /api/predict` → Returns mock prediction result (simulated delay 1–2s)  
- `GET /api/wearables` → Returns mock wearable data (heart rate, sleep hours)

## ⚡ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # start locally (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build     # build for production
```

## 📦 Deployment on Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket  
2. In Vercel → New Project → Import Repository  
3. Framework preset: **Vite**  
4. Build command: `npm run build`  
5. Output directory: `dist`  
6. Ensure `vercel.json` includes SPA fallback:  

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/.*", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

7. Deploy 🚀

## 🔮 Extension Considerations

- **Authentication & Security**  
  Add login/session handling (JWT, secure cookies). Store health data securely using HTTPS and encrypted DB.

- **From Mock to Real APIs**  
  Replace MSW endpoints with actual backend REST APIs or GraphQL. React Query integration remains unchanged.

- **Handling Long AI API Latency**  
  Show busy loaders, skeleton screens, or optimistic UI updates while awaiting 3–4s responses.

- **Data Persistence**  
  Move from session-only storage to database (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, or custom Node.js/Express + Postgres).

- **Staging & Handoff**  
  Create a staging environment on Vercel with preview deployments. Document setup in README so new devs can onboard quickly.
